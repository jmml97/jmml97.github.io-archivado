> You have to understand how caffeine affects you. After it's absorbed through your small intestine and passes into your bloodstream, it crosses into your brain. There, it fits into receptors that are normally filled by a similarly shaped molecule called adenosine.
>
> Adenosine is a byproduct of brain activity, and when it accumulates at high enough levels, it plugs into these receptors and makes you feel tired. But with the caffeine blocking the receptors, it's unable to do so.
>
> Now, caffeine doesn't block every single adenosine receptor — it competes with adenosine for these spots, filling some, but not others.
>
> But here's the trick of the coffee nap: sleeping naturally clears adenosine from the brain (...) It takes around 20 minutes for the caffeine to get through your gastrointestinal tract and bloodstream anyway.
>
> So if you nap for those 20 minutes, you'll reduce your levels of adenosine just in time for the caffeine to kick in.

Es un artículo de 2015 y aunque algo me sonaba la verdad es que no lo había leído.  Yo he probado en alguna ocasión a dormir alrededor de 20 minutos para descansar sin entrar en sueño profundo, pero nunca he probado a tomar café antes. Entendiendo como funciona la cafeína uno ve lógico este método y ahora tengo bastante curiosidad por probarlo.
